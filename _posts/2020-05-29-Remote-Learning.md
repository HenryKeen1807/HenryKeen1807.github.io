    <td>This is my remote learning project of making a website during the COVID 19 Pandemic. Instead of using dreamweaver I opted to use github as I had already used it in the past and know how to use it. I have have created a website called 'Remote learning website' and included a link to an 'about' page and a 'blog' page (the main page). This website could be used as a remote learning Blog in the future. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I have added an image, put two pages together with a link, a background and containers both having a gradient and being translucent. Overall, this website has been very successful in my opinion and did not take that long to create. There are not many more features I can inculde to better this website. <iframe src="https://www.fia.uk.com/uploads/assets/e414d9b7-217c-4e18-84217e7f5d3d3014/image810x329_b89b2cfb71236ee94bab9f96ad3e2b60/iStock-848924858.jpg" width="770" height="380"></iframe>   </td>
