    <td>Today I learned how to use coding for the FUZE box. Especially 'flashing lights' Which I had never used in much detail before. Me and my partner found a way to get into a good habit of switching navigator and pilot regularly which helped the work of our coding and progression in the booklet to fasten. Aayush and I swapped by one person doing the wires and one person does the code.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning, except that we worked quite slow. But it was a successful first lesson using the FUZE and I am exceedingly happy with what I have achieved. We did get into a good habit of being quick at the switching between the rota we created.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by progressing more and taking more practice in coding and at the pace we worked. But overall this was a really good lesson and I can’t wait to do more coding using ‘flashing lights’ because it was a new insight to code and the many uses you can use it for. This was a very interesting lesson.</td>
