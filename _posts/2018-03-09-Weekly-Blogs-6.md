    <td>I learned by being attentive and ears-open to my partner whom of which explained what we did last week when I was absent. He showed me how to create a string code involving probability, chance and numbers which was extremely interesting. The strategies that were effective this week were to work at a comfortable pace, slowly but fast.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning would be most probably be the fact that I had missed a lesson so I wasn't really using the right habits which I had learnt. Although my partner explained it to me, it was my fault that I didn’t help him apply what he learnt last week, for this week. I need to get back into the rhythm of navigator and pilot, that’s all.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>By next week, I would have re-learnt my habits and applied them to my FUZE coding, but a positive is that I brought my USB drive and was much more organised than from two weeks ago. I will improve my learning by practicing more and being more helpful towards my partner and also I will ask him when i’m stuck.</td>
