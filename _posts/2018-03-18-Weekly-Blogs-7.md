  <tr>
    <td>I learned how to write and use code for the FUZE box, involving string code and I understood it, the booklet explained what went where and why it went there. I learned by being very inquisitive and understanding of the code. We used string code to involve numbers by a guessing game of 'higher or lower'. This meant we could uses numbers, symbols and many other new code.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning is that me and my partner weren’t as rehearsed as the week before. Meaning that we didn’t switch regularly, therefore limiting my ability of reading and writing the code which would effect my learning. All in all I think that this was a productive lesson and we achieved our goal which was to get onto ‘electrical lights’.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will be a bit more attentive and helpful towards my partner because I wasn’t very helpful or productive so I could aid him more in the coding and support him more by swapping navigator and pilot more regularly but we did as I say get onto ‘electrical lights’ which was quite fun and I hope to do more next lesson.</td>
