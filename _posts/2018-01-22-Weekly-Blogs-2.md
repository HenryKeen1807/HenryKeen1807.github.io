    <td>Today I learned how to use coding for the FUZE box. Which I had never used before and this was my first time. Me and my partner found a way to get into a good habit of switching navigator and pilot regularly. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not much limited my learning, except that we worked quite slow. But it was a successful first lesson using the FUZE and I am exceedingly happy with what I have achieved. We did get into a good habit of being quick at the coding.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by progressing more and taking more practice in coding and at the pace we worked. But overall this was a really good first lesson and I can't wait to do more coding. This was a very interesting lesson</td>
