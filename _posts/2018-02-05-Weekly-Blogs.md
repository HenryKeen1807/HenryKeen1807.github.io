    <td>Today, we learnt how to use string code which is quite interesting, we got to answer our own questions and use the code successfully. It was fun moving on and using different code because it was getting a bit too much repeating the same code over and over again. So I learnt by doing something new to interest me. My strategy was to do one thing to the fullest extent of my ability and do the same for the next one. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We could have worked at a faster pace because we just got onto using string coding and we wanted to do more, we will be more organised and switch navigator and pilot more regularly because we only switched once or twice. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by carrying with what i'm doing because I am making loads of progress and am very proud of my knowledge of coding, considering that i’m new. Also another way to improve my learning would be to be more organised because I forgot my USB drive, but fortunately my partner brought his so we saved the work on his.</td>
