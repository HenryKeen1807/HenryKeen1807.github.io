(add details to “Lesson Review”)</td>

    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learned how to make a repeat cycle for the light. This happened because my partner and I work successfully together, swapping pilot and navigator regularly. We used the booklet, learning code and advancing on both working effectively and efficiently.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning was that we took time to get started because we didn't understand it but one of our peers helped us and got us going. I need to work on communicating more to my partner although we did make progress, I feel that we could of had more. But all in all this was a good start to a topic we had no idea about.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my role and be more of a leader, communicating more with my partner and working at a faster pace. I will improve my learning by getting more done in the lesson, to do this I have to be more organised and faster at setting up the fuze box because we couldn’t figure out which wires went where.</td>
