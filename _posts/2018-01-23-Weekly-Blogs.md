  <tr>
    <td>We learnt how to use code to create a simplistic equation with school boys and girls. We were a lot more organised this week than last week because we came in, plugged our usb in and got on with it whereas last time it wouldn't save and we had trouble with our Fuze box which limited our learning. This week we made substantial progress, starting a new topic of equations.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The thing that limited our learning was that we got stuck on a silly mistake in our code and we didn’t know what it was until later, this completely slowed down our learning but we then flew through the booklet, very quickly and mde progress. We need to work on our communication and be more precise in what we say because I told him the code but he didn’t know whether there was a space or an equals sign.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning next time by using all my resources and being more specific and accurate next time, telling him and showing him exactly what to write on the code. I will be more pinpoint in what to do, as Aayush does with me. If I do this then we can avoid errors and tighten the margin of error.</td>
