Lesson Review
How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 
I learned how to make a repeat cycle with a coloured background. This happened because my partner and I work successfully together, swapping pilot and navigator regularly. We used the booklet, learning code and advancing on 
What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 
What limited my learning was that we took time to get started because we didn’t understand it but one of our peers helped us and got us going. I need to work on communicating more to my partner although we did make progress, I feel that we could of had more. In all fairness, our fuze box stopped working half-way through the lesson.
What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?
I will change my role and be more of a leader, communicating more with my partner and working at a faster pace. I will improve my learning by getting more done in the lesson, to do this I have to be more organised and faster at setting up the fuze box because we had problems half-way through.
