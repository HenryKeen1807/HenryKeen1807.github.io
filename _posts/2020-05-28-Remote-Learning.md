    <td>This is my remote learning project of making a website during the COVID 19 Pandemic. Instead of using dreamweaver I opted to use github as I had already used it in the past and know how to use it. I have have created a website called 'Remote learning website' and included a link to an 'about' page and a 'blog' page, the main page. This website could be used as a remote learning Blog in the future. </td>
