    <td>I was absent this day so my partner brought me up to speed, he said we used a variety of string code and numbers creating a conversation between the code and the user. He showed me the code and it looked really complicated but then he ran me through it and it turned out it was quite easy.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

    <td>I was absent so I caught up and learned that a piece in the code was quite hard so my partner ran me through it twice, pointing out specific details of what he did and what I should do next time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Hopefully, I am not absent again so I can learn more coding in IT, it sounded like fun and looked quite interesting, I wish I could have been there this lesson.</td>
